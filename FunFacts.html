        <h5>Traveling</h5>
    <section>
        <p>I like to travel with my family, but not too far. The farthest I've gone is Florida. My family and I went to Florida three times, the first being just going on vacation and the other times spending Christmas with my grandparents. The top three best places I've been are the Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, A live show called "Brain Candy" featuring Adam Savage and Micheal Steavens (VSauce), and lastly a live show of my favorite NPR talkshow, Wait Wait Don't Tell Me.</p>

        <h5>Hobbies</h5>
    <section>
        <p>I like to doodle in my free time. Recently I've been practicing with figure drawing because I couldn't draw a realistic human for the life of me. Taking an art course at CCV was really helpful. I also like reading when I have the time. My favorite genres for novels are Sci-Fi and Fantasy. I also read a lot of graphic novels such as Garfield, Calvin and Hobbes, and Foxtrot.</p>
